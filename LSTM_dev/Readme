lstm_on_min_data(midprice).ipynb: 
input_size: 50 steps output: 10 steps
Three different model structures of LSTM was tested on mid-price predictions.
Data was separated into train(70%), val(20%) and test(10%) <- I will try to separate the data into train(JAN-April) val(may) test(June and July)
The result shows that stacking 2 layers of LSTM yeilds the best result on validation set and test set in this case
